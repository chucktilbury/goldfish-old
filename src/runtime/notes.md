# Adding an external function
Adding an external function is very easy and the interface to the assembler is very straight forward. The idea is to have the values in either the value stack or in registers available to the external function that you want to call and then place the return value in what ever form it takes into the stack or in registers according to the needs of the external that is being interfaced.

In general the steps are as follows:
- Add the name to the enum in traps.h
- Add the name to the include file traps.inc. This is included by the assembler to call out the trap number. It has to match the number that was defined in traps.h (in the future, traps.inc will be generated by make)
- Implement the interface function.
- Add the interface function to the switch/case in traps.c.
